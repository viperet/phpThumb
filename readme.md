# phpThumb for PHP 7.0

Do you love deprecated functions? I sure do. With Rackspace finally catching up with upgrading all their PHP clusers to 5.3, i've had more and more third party plugins go bust with functions being deprecated. Here is my first fix published to a repo, many more to come.

This is a patched version of phpThumb that has deprecated functions in php5.3 replaced.

Deprecated functions replaced:

	ereg{}
	eregi{}
	

I offer NO support or guarantees with this code, so make sure you always have backups. I can tell you that this code works on a number of Wordpress sites that I have built that use third party plugins that call for phpThumb.
